## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? We want to know about it!

1. **Check existing issues** - Someone might have already reported it
2. **Create a new issue** - Use the bug report template
3. **Provide details**:
   - What happened?
   - What did you expect?
   - Steps to reproduce
   - macOS version and system info

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea? We'd love to hear it!

1. **Check existing discussions** - See if it's already been suggested
2. **Start a discussion** - Use the feature request template
3. **Explain your idea**:
   - What problem does it solve?
   - How would it work?
   - Why would it be valuable?

### Submitting Code

Ready to code? Awesome! Here's how:

#### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stockup-app.git
cd stockup-app
```

#### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

#### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow Swift naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test your changes thoroughly

#### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: brief description of your change"
```

**Commit message tips:**
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reference issue numbers if applicable

#### 5. Push & Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- Clear title and description
- What you changed and why
- Screenshots (if UI changes)
- Reference to related issues

## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Swift conventions** - Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines
- **SwiftUI patterns** - Use native components and patterns
- **Naming** - Clear, descriptive names
- **Comments** - Explain "why", not "what"

### Architecture

- **MVVM pattern** - Keep business logic separate from UI
- **Async/Await** - Use modern Swift concurrency
- **Native APIs** - Prefer SwiftUI and macOS native solutions
- **Free APIs only** - Don't add dependencies on paid services

### Testing

- Test your changes manually
- Verify on different macOS versions if possible
- Check edge cases (empty data, API failures, etc.)
